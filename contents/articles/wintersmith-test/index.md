Well here's to my first blog post in Wintersmith.  I wonder if I like the directory structure as much as middleman.  Primarily the simplicity of the directory structure for the markdown files in middleman.  Wintersmith seems to require a folder and then markdown files per post inside, whereas for middleman you can have one big folder and many markdown files inside.

<span class="more"></span>

We shall see which one is easier to work with. Who knows, I may still jump the boat and go with the kitchen sink Javascript engine of docpad. Wintersmith seems simpler but we'll see.

Perhaps its just because I went with the default template install rather than a buildup from scratch.  Who knows, maybe it was a setting in the templates and layouts.
